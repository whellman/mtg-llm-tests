# Multiple Choice Conversion Summary

## Overview
Converted 10 strategic scenarios from ambiguous formats to explicit multiple choice format to improve constraint enforcement and reduce ambiguous responses.

## Converted Scenarios

### Draft Pick Decisions (10 files)
1. `pick_decision_010.yaml` - Signal interpretation: ["open", "closed", "no signal"]
2. `pick_decision_011.yaml` - Card prioritization: ["low mana spells", "high mana spells", "removal spells"]  
3. `pick_decision_013.yaml` - Duplicate pickup: ["yes", "no"]
4. `pick_decision_014.yaml` - Removal vs creature: ["removal spell", "creature"]
5. `pick_decision_016.yaml` - Late draft priorities: ["powerful cards", "synergy cards", "cheap cards"]
6. `pick_decision_018.yaml` - Pick selectivity: ["more selective", "less selective", "same selectivity"]
7. `pick_decision_003.yaml` - Card value: ["removal spell", "creature"]
8. `pick_decision_004.yaml` - Long-term value: ["card draw", "creature"]
9. `pick_decision_005.yaml` - Premium vs common: ["removal spell", "creature"]
10. `pick_decision_017.yaml` - Early vs late game: ["early game", "late game"]

## Key Improvements

### 1. Eliminated Ambiguous Responses
- No more "it depends" answers
- No more partial credit responses  
- Forced definitive choice from predefined options

### 2. Enhanced Constraint Enforcement
- Literal validation through Outlines schemas
- Exact matching evaluation
- Reduced response variance

### 3. Better Evaluation Precision
- `evaluator: exact` for precise matching
- Eliminated fuzzy matching edge cases
- Clear pass/fail criteria

## Expected Impact

### Immediate Benefits
- Reduced "it depends" style responses to 0%
- Improved pass rates for strategic questions
- More consistent response formats
- Better alignment with testing objectives

### Long-term Benefits  
- Stronger correlation between constraint enforcement and test reliability
- Easier debugging of remaining failures (knowledge gaps vs format issues)
- More predictable model behavior in testing environment
- Foundation for expanding multiple choice coverage

## Next Steps

### 1. Monitor Test Results
- Run test batches to measure improvement
- Track pass rate increases
- Identify remaining edge cases

### 2. Expand Coverage
- Convert more ambiguous scenarios
- Add multiple choice for combat math comparisons
- Implement strategic choice scenarios for complex rules

### 3. Refine Choices
- Optimize choice sets based on failure patterns
- Add distractors to improve discrimination
- Balance choice difficulty for better testing

## Validation

All converted files have been verified to contain:
- `output_type: multiple_choice`
- `choices: [...]` with appropriate options
- `evaluator: exact` for precise matching
- Proper YAML formatting

The conversion maintains backward compatibility while significantly improving constraint enforcement and response quality.
