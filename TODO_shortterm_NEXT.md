Structured output overhaul. We don't need to worry about any other model methodology for now if we can get our HF tranformers to reliably work with structured output.
Evaluators need to be updated, either before structured overhaul (an easy bandaid is case-insensitivity) or after (at which point the whole way tests are evaluated will probably need to be adjusted or overhauled, to deal with output structure--do we define this somehow in the yaml of the test, or do we robustly support a handful of explicitly-known structures?).
